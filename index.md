### CPSC 120

* Lab 4 (Part 1)

    Lab 4, Part 1 was one of the projects that I enjoyed. It was quite simple, but this is the lab where I started to understand the basics in a better manner. This lab included using doubles and ints, as well as cins and couts. It encouraged me to want to try more difficult tasks.

* Lab 6 (Part 2)

    Lab 6, Part 2 caught my attention when I realized that the function of this code was the same as basic math. It helped me connect my mathematics course with programming, which I found interesting. The code took the user's input of arithmetic numbers and calculated the average

* Lab 5 (Part 2)

    Out of all the labs, Lab 5, Part 2 was definitely my favorite. Creating the blackjack portion of the lab was particularly enjoyable. Since it's a game I'm familiar with, assigning face card values and establishing rules was straightforward. The code was also challenging enough to be engaging and educational for a beginner like myself. Best of all, I was able to play the game and see my code in action.
