### CPSC 120

* Lab 4 (Part 1)

    Lab 4, part 1 was one of the projects I enjoyed. It was quite simple but this is the lab where I started to understand the basics in a better manner. This lab inclued using doubles/ints as well as cins and couts. It encouraged me in a way to want to try more difficult tasks.

* Lab 6 (Part 2)

    Lab 6, part 2 caught my attention when I had realized that the function of this code was the same as doing basic math. It helped me tie in my mathemtics course into programming which I found interesting. The code grabbed the users input of arithmetic numbers and found the average.

* Lab 5 (Part 2)

    Lab 5, part 2 was by far my favorite lab. The black jack portion of this lab was fun to make as its a game I am familiar with. The code was challenging enough for someone learning c++ so I enjoyed coding and learning along the way. It was also a game I could actually interact with.
